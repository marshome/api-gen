It is used by\n[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,\nand error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",

Replaces\nany existing policy.\n\nThe following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:\n\n+ Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as\n`members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.\n\n+ The owner role can be granted only to `user` and `serviceAccount`.\n\n+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly\nwithout any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be\ninvited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.\n\n+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user\nmust be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must\nexplicitly accept the invitation.\n\n+ Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using\n`setIamPolicy()`;\nthey must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.\n\n+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have\naccepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.\n\n+ There must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of\nService (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to\nto remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This\nrestriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners\nwho have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until\nthe lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified.\n\n+ Calling this method requires enabling the App Engine Admin API.\n\nNote: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles\ncan render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand\nhow the service account is being used before removing or updating its\nroles.",
